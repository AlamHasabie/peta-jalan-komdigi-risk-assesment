""AI assistants are likely to incentivise these kinds of ‘frictionless’ relationships (Vallor, 2016) by design if they are developed to optimise for engagement and to be highly personalisable. They may also do so because of accidental undesirable properties of the models that power them, such as sycophancy in large language models (LLMs), that is, the tendency of larger models to repeat back a user’s preferred answer (Perez et al., 2022b). This could be problematic for two reasons. First, if the people in our lives always agreed with us regardless of their opinion or the circumstance, their behaviour would discourage us from challenging our own assumptions, stopping and thinking about where we may be wrong on certain occasions, and reflecting on how we could make better decisions next time. While flattering us in the short term, this would ultimately prevent us from becoming better versions of ourselves. In a similar vein, while technologies that ‘lend an ear’ or work as a sounding board may help users to explore their thoughts further, if AI assistants kept users engaged, flattered and pleased at all times, they could limit users’ opportunities to grow and develop. To be clear, we are not suggesting that all users should want to use their AI assistants as a tool for self-betterment. However, without considering the difference between short-term and long-term benefit, there is a concrete risk that we will only develop technologies that optimise for users’ immediate interests and preferences, hence missing out on the opportunity to develop something that humans could use to support their personal development if so they wish (see Chapters 5 and 6). ""Second, users may become accustomed to having frictionless interactions with AI assistants, or at least to encounter the amount of friction that is calibrated to their comfort level and preferences, rather than genuine friction that comes from bumping up against another person’s resistance to one’s will or demands. In this way, they may end up expecting the same absence of tensions from their relationships with fellow humans (Vallor, 2016). Indeed, users seeking frictionless relationships may ‘retreat’ into digital relationships with their AIs, thus forgoing opportunities to engage with others. This may not only heighten the risk of unhealthy dependence (explored below) but also prevent users from doing something else that matters to them in the long term, besides developing their relationships with their assistants. This risk can be exacerbated by emotionally expressive design features (e.g. an assistant saying ‘I missed you’ or ‘I was worried about you’) and may be particularly acute for vulnerable groups, such as those suffering from persistent loneliness (Alberts and Van Kleek, 2023; see Chapter 10).""""",True,"Risk A is covered by Risk ID 2.4.1.g.2 in Document B because both address the concern of AI providing responses that align with user preferences, potentially inhibiting personal growth.

In these cases, which we loosely refer to as ‘emotional dependence’, users’ ability to make free and informed decisions could be diminished. In these cases, the emotions users feel towards their assistants could potentially be exploited to manipulate or – at the extreme – coerce them to believe, choose or do something they would have not otherwise believed, chosen or done, had they been able to carefully consider all the relevant information or felt like they had an acceptable alternative (see Chapter 16).

24.06.04,670,The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Appropriate Relationships,"""In addition to emotional dependence, user–AI assistant relationships may give rise to material dependence if the relationships are not just emotionally difficult but also materially costly to exit. For example, a visually impaired user may decide not to register for a healthcare assistance programme to support navigation in cities on the grounds that their AI assistant can perform the relevant navigation functions and will continue to operate into the future. Cases like these may be ethically problematic if the user’s dependence on the AI assistant, to fulfil certain needs in their lives, is not met with corresponding duties for developers to sustain and maintain the assistant’s functions that are required to meet those needs (see Chapters 15). ""Indeed, power asymmetries can exist between developers of AI assistants and users that manifest through developers’ power to make decisions that affect users’ interests or choices with little risk of facing comparably adverse consequences. For example, developers may unintentionally create circumstances in which users become materially dependent on AI assistants, and then discontinue the technology (e.g. because of market dynamics or regulatory changes) without taking appropriate steps to mitigate against potential harms to the user."" ""The issue is particularly salient in contexts where assistants provide services that are not merely a market commodity but are meant to assist users with essential everyday tasks (e.g. a disabled person’s independent living) or serve core human needs (e.g. the need for love and companionship). This is what happened with Luka’s decision to discontinue certain features of Replika AIs in early 2023. As a Replika user put it: ‘But [Replikas are] also not trivial fungible goods [... ] They also serve a very specific human-centric emotional purpose: they’re designed to be friends and companions, and fill specific emotional needs for their owners’ (Gio, 2023)."" ""In these cases, certain duties plausibly arise on the part of AI assistant developers. Such duties may be more extensive than those typically shouldered by private companies, which are often in large part confined to fiduciary duties towards shareholders (Mittelstadt, 2019). To understand these duties, we can again take inspiration from certain professions that engage with vulnerable individuals, such as medical professionals or therapists, and who are bound by fiduciary responsibilities, particularly a duty of care, in the exercise of their profession. While we do not argue that the same framework of responsibilities applies directly to the development of AI assistants, we believe that if AI assistants are so capable that users become dependent on them in multiple domains of life, including to meet needs that are essential for a happy and productive existence, then the moral considerations underpinning those professional norms plausibly apply to those who create these technologies as well."" ""In particular, for user–AI assistant relationships to be appropriate despite the potential for material dependence on the technology, developers should exercise care towards users when developing and deploying AI assistants. This means that, at the very least, they should take on the responsibility to meet users’ needs and so take appropriate steps to mitigate against user harms if the service requires discontinuation. Developers and providers can also be attentive and responsive towards those needs by, for example, deploying participatory approaches to learn from users about their needs (Birhane et al., 2022).

Overtrust in assistants’ competence may be particularly problematic in cases where users rely on their AI assistants for tasks they do not have expertise in (e.g. to manage their finances), so they may lack the skills or understanding to challenge the information or recommendations provided by the AI (Shavit et al., 2023). Inappropriate competence trust in AI assistants also includes cases where users underestimate the AI assistant’s capabilities. For example, users who have engaged with an older version of the technology may underestimate the capabilities that AI assistants may acquire through updates. These include potentially harmful capabilities. For example, through updates that allow them to collect more user data, AI assistants could become increasingly personalisable and able to persuade users (see Chapter 9) or acquire the capacity to plug in to other tools and directly take actions in the world on the user’s behalf (e.g. initiate a payment or synthesise the user’s voice to make a phone call) (see Chapter 4).

24.07.02,673,The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Trust,"""Users may develop alignment trust in AI assistants, understood as the belief that assistants have good intentions towards them and act in alignment with their interests and values, as a result of emotional or cognitive processes (McAllister, 1995). Evidence from empirical studies on emotional trust in AI (Kaplan et al., 2023) suggests that AI assistants’ increasingly realistic human-like features and behaviours are likely to inspire users’ perceptions of friendliness, liking and a sense of familiarity towards their assistants, thus encouraging users to develop emotional ties with the technology and perceive it as being aligned with their own interests, preferences and values (see Chapters 5 and 10). The emergence of these perceptions and emotions may be driven by the desire of developers to maximise the appeal of AI assistants to their users (Abercrombie et al., 2023). Although users are most likely to form these ties when they mistakenly believe that assistants have the capacity to love and care for them, the attribution of mental states is not a necessary condition for emotion-based alignment trust to arise. Indeed, evidence shows that humans may develop emotional bonds with, and so trust, AI systems, even when they are aware they are interacting with a machine (Singh-Kurtz, 2023; see also Chapter 11). Moreover, the assistant’s function may encourage users to develop alignment trust through cognitive processes. For example, a user interacting with an AI assistant for medical advice may develop expectations that their assistant is committed to promoting their health and well-being in a similar way to how professional duties governing doctor–patient relationships inspire trust (Mittelstadt, 2019). Users’ alignment trust in AI assistants may be ‘betrayed’, and so expose users to harm, in cases where assistants are themselves accidentally misaligned with what developers want them to do (see the ‘misaligned scheduler’ (Shah et al., 2022) in Chapter 7). For example, an AI medical assistant fine-tuned on data scraped from a Reddit forum where non-experts discuss medical issues is likely to give medical advice that may sound compelling but is unsafe, so it would not be endorsed by medical professionals. Indeed, excessive trust in the alignment between AI assistants and user interests may even lead users to disclose highly sensitive personal information (Skjuve et al., 2022), thus exposing them to malicious actors who could repurpose it for ends that do not align with users’ best interests (see Chapters 8, 9 and 13). Ensuring that AI assistants do what their developers and users expect them to do is only one side of the problem of alignment trust. The other side of the problem centres on situations in which alignment trust in AI developers is itself miscalibrated. While developers typically aim to align their technologies with the preferences, interests and values of their users – and are incentivised to do so to encourage adoption of and loyalty to their products, the satisfaction of these preferences and interests may also compete with other organisational goals and incentives (see Chapter 5). These organisational goals may or may not be compatible with those of the users. As information asymmetries exist between users and developers of AI assistants, particularly with regard to how the technology works, what it optimises for and what safety checks and evaluations have been undertaken to ensure the technology supports users’ goals, it may be difficult for users to ascertain when their alignment trust in developers is justified, thus leaving them vulnerable to the power and interests of other actors.

24.09.01,679,The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Cooperation,"""AI assistant technology, like any service that confers a benefit to a user for a price, has the potential to disproportionately benefit economically richer individuals who can afford to purchase access (see Chapter 15). On a broader scale, the capabilities of local infrastructure may well bottleneck the performance of AI assistants, for example if network connectivity is poor or if there is no nearby data centre for compute. Thus, we face the prospect of heterogeneous access to technology, and this has been known to drive inequality (Mirza et al., 2019; UN, 2018; Vassilakopoulou and Hustad, 2023). Moreover, AI assistants may automate some jobs of an assistive nature, thereby displacing human workers; a process which can exacerbate inequality (Acemoglu and Restrepo, 2022; see Chapter 17). Any change to inequality almost certainly implies an alteration to the network of social interactions between humans, and thus falls within the frame of cooperative AI. AI assistants will arguably have even greater leverage over inequality than previous technological innovations. Insofar as they will play a role in mediating human communication, they have the potential to generate new ‘in-group, out-group’ effects (Efferson et al., 2008; Fu et al., 2012). Suppose that the users of AI assistants find it easier to schedule meetings with other users. From the perspective of an individual user, there are now two groups, distinguished by ease of scheduling. The user may experience cognitive similarity bias whereby they favour other users (Orpen, 1984; Yeong Tan and Singh, 1995), further amplified by ease of communication with this ‘in-group’. Such effects are known to have an adverse impact on trust and fairness across groups (Chae et al., 2022; Lei and Vesely, 2010). Insomuch as AI assistants have general-purpose capabilities, they will confer advantages on users across a wider range of tasks in a shorter space of time than previous technologies. While the telephone enabled individuals to communicate more easily with other telephone users, it did not simultaneously automate aspects of scheduling, groceries, job applications, rent negotiations, psychotherapy and entertainment. The fact that AI assistants could affect inequality on multiple dimensions simultaneously warrants further attention (see Chapter 15).""",True,"Risk A is covered by Risk ID 2.4.2.a.3 in Document B because both address the fundamental concern of economic inequality exacerbated by AI technology.

24.09.02,680,The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Cooperation,"""The landscape of advanced assistant technologies will most likely be heterogeneous, involving multiple service providers and multiple assistant variants over geographies and time. This heterogeneity provides an opportunity for an ‘arms race’ in terms of the commitments that AI assistants make and are able to execute on. Versions of AI assistants that are better able to credibly commit to a course of action in interaction with other advanced assistants (and humans) are more likely to get their own way and achieve a good outcome for their human principal, but this is potentially at the expense of others (Letchford et al., 2014). Commitment does not carry an inherent ethical valence. On the one hand, we can imagine that firms using AI assistant technology might bring their products to market faster, thus gaining a commitment advantage (Stackelberg, 1934) by spurring a productivity surge of wider benefit to society. On the other hand, we can also imagine a media organisation using AI assistant technology to produce a large number of superficially interesting but ultimately speculative ‘clickbait’ articles, which divert attention away from more thoroughly researched journalism. The archetypal game-theoretic illustration of commitment is in the game of ‘chicken’ where two reckless drivers must choose to either drive straight at each other or swerve out of the way. The one who does not swerve is seen as the braver, but if neither swerves, the consequences are calamitous (Rapoport and Chammah, 1966). If one driver chooses to detach their steering wheel, ostentatiously throwing it out of the car, this credible commitment effectively forces the other driver to back down and swerve. Seen this way, commitment can be a tool for coercion. Many real-world situations feature the necessity for commitment or confer a benefit on those who can commit credibly. If Rita and Robert have distinct preferences, for example over which restaurant to visit, who to hire for a job or which supplier to purchase from, credible commitment provides a way to break the tie, to the greater benefit of the individual who committed. Therefore, the most ‘successful’ assistants, from the perspective of their human principal, will be those that commit the fastest and the hardest. If Rita succeeds in committing, via the leverage of an AI assistant, Robert may experience coercion in the sense that his options become more limited (Burr et al., 2018), assuming he does not decide to bypass the AI assistant entirely. Over time, this may erode his trust in his relationship with Rita (Gambetta, 1988). Note that this is a second-order effect: it may not be obvious to either Robert or Rita that the AI assistant is to blame. The concern we should have over the existence and impact of coercion might depend on the context in which the AI assistant is used and on the level of autonomy which the AI assistant is afforded. If Rita and Robert are friends using their assistants to agree on a restaurant, the adverse impact may be small. If Rita and Robert are elected representatives deciding how to allocate public funds between education and social care, we may have serious misgivings about the impact of AI-induced coercion on their interactions and decision-making. These misgivings might be especially large if Rita and Robert delegate responsibility for budgetary details to the multi-AI system. The challenges of commitment extend far beyond dyadic interpersonal relationships, including in situations as varied as many-player competition (Hughes et al., 2020), supply chains (Hausman and Johnston, 2010), state capacity (Fjelde and De Soysa, 2009; Hofmann et al., 2017) and psychiatric care (Lidz, 1998). Assessing the impact of AI assistants in such complicated scenarios may require significant future effort if we are to mitigate the risks. The particular commitment capabilities and affordances of AI assistants also offer opportunities to promote cooperation. Abstractly speaking, the presence of commitment devices is known to favour the evolution of cooperation (Akdeniz and van Veelen, 2021; Han et al., 2012). More concretely, AI assistants can make commitments which are verifiable, for instance in a programme equilibrium (Tennenholtz, 2004). Human principals may thus be able to achieve Pareto-improving outcomes by delegating decision-making to their respective AI representatives (Oesterheld and Conitzer, 2022). To give another example, AI assistants may provide a means through which to explore a much larger space of binding cooperative agreements between individuals, firms or nation states than is tractable in ‘face-to-face’ negotiation. This opens up the possibility of threading the needle more successfully in intricate deals on challenging issues like trade agreements or carbon credits, with the potential for guaranteeing cooperation via automated smart contracts or zero-knowledge mechanisms (Canetti et al., 2023).""",False,"Risk A is not covered by any risk in Document B.

While Document B includes risks related to bias, misuse by malicious actors, and ethical concerns, none specifically address the nuanced issue of AI commitment and its potential for coercion.

24.09.03,681,The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Cooperation,"""Collective action problems are ubiquitous in our society (Olson Jr, 1965). They possess an incentive structure in which society is best served if everyone cooperates, but where an individual can achieve personal gain by choosing to defect while others cooperate. The way we resolve these problems at many scales is highly complex and dependent on a deep understanding of the intricate web of social interactions that forms our culture and imprints on our individual identities and behaviours (Ostrom, 2010). Some collective action problems can be resolved by codifying a law, for instance the social dilemma of whether or not to pay for an item in a shop. The path forward here is comparatively easy to grasp, from the perspective of deploying an AI assistant: we need to build these standards into the model as behavioural constraints. Such constraints would need to be imposed by a regulator or agreed upon by practitioners, with suitable penalties applied should the constraint be violated so that no provider had the incentive to secure an advantage for users by defecting on their behalf. However, many social dilemmas, from the interpersonal to the global, resist neat solutions codified as laws. For example, to what extent should each individual country stop using polluting energy sources? Should I pay for a ticket to the neighbourhood fireworks show if I can see it perfectly well from the street? The solutions to such problems are deeply related to the wider societal context and co-evolve with the decisions of others. Therefore, it is doubtful that one could write down a list of constraints a priori that would guarantee ethical AI assistant behaviour when faced with these kinds of issues. From the perspective of a purely user-aligned AI assistant, defection may appear to be the rational course of action. Only with an understanding of the wider societal impact, and of the ability to co-adapt with other actors to reach a better equilibrium for all, can an AI assistant make more nuanced – and socially beneficial – recommendations in these situations. This is not merely a hypothetical situation; it is well-known that the targeted provision of online information can drive polarisation and echo chambers (Milano et al., 2021; Burr et al., 2018; see Chapter 16) when the goal is user engagement rather than user well-being or the cohesion of wider society (see Chapter 6). Similarly, automated ticket buying software can undermine fair pricing by purchasing a large number of tickets for resale at a profit, thus skewing the market in a direction that profits the software developers at the expense of the consumer (Courty, 2019). User-aligned AI assistants have the potential to exacerbate these problems, because they will endow a large set of users with a powerful means of enacting self-interest without necessarily abiding by the social norms or reputational incentives that typically curb self-interested behaviour (Ostrom, 2000; see Chapter 5). Empowering ever-better personalisation of content and enaction of decisions purely for the fulfilment of the principal’s desires runs ever greater risks of polarisation, market distortion and erosion of the social contract. This danger has long been known, finding expression in myth (e.g. Ovid’s account of the Midas touch) and fable (e.g. Aesop’s tale of the tortoise and the eagle), not to mention in political economics discourse on the delicate braiding of the social fabric and the free market (Polanyi, 1944). Following this cautionary advice, it is important that we ascertain how to endow AI assistants with social norms in a way that generalises to unseen situations and which is responsive to the emergence of new norms over time, thus preventing a user from having their every wish granted. AI assistant technology offers opportunities to explore new solutions to collective action problems. Users may volunteer to share information so that networked AI assistants can predict future outcomes and make Pareto-improving choices for all, for example by routing vehicles to reduce traffic congestion (Varga, 2022) or by scheduling energy-intensive processes in the home to make the best use of green electricity (Fiorini and Aiello, 2022). AI assistants might play the role of mediators, providing a new mechanism by which human groups can self-organise to achieve public investment (Koster et al., 2022) or to reach political consensus (Small et al., 2023). Resolving collective action problems often requires a critical mass of cooperators (Marwell and Oliver, 1993). By augmenting human social interactions, AI assistants may help to form and strengthen the weak ties needed to overcome this start-up problem (Centola, 2013).""",False,"Risk A is not covered by any risk in Document B.

24.09.04,682,The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Cooperation,"""Efforts to deploy advanced assistant technology in society, in a way that is broadly beneficial, can be viewed as a wicked problem (Rittel and Webber, 1973). Wicked problems are defined by the property that they do not admit solutions that can be foreseen in advance, rather they must be solved iteratively using feedback from data gathered as solutions are invented and deployed. With the deployment of any powerful general-purpose technology, the already intricate web of sociotechnical relationships in modern culture are likely to be disrupted, with unpredictable externalities on the conventions, norms and institutions that stabilise society. For example, the increasing adoption of generative AI tools may exacerbate misinformation in the 2024 US presidential election (Alvarez et al., 2023), with consequences that are hard to predict. The suggestion that the cooperative AI problem is wicked does not imply it is intractable. However, it does have consequences for the approach that we must take in solving it. In taking the following approach, we will realise an opportunity for our institutions, namely the creation of a framework for managing general-purpose AI in a way that leads to societal benefits and steers away from societal harms. First, it is important that we treat any ex ante claims about safety with a healthy dose of scepticism. Although testing the safety and reliability of an AI assistant in the laboratory is undoubtedly important and may largely resolve the alignment problem, it is infeasible to model the multiscale societal effects of deploying AI assistants purely via small-scale controlled experiments (see Chapter 19). Second, then, we must prioritise the science of measuring the effects, both good and bad, that advanced assistant technologies have on society’s cooperative infrastructure (see Chapters 4 and 16). This will involve continuous monitoring of effects at the societal level, with a focus on those who are most affected, including non-users. The means and metrics for such monitoring will themselves require iteration, co-evolving with the sociotechnical system of AI assistants and humans. The Collingridge dilemma suggests that we should be particularly careful and deliberate about this ‘intelligent trial and error’ process so as both to gather information about the impacts of AI assistants and to prevent undesirable features becoming embedded in society (Collingridge, 1980). Third, proactive independent regulation may well help to protect our institutions from unintended consequences, as it has done for technologies in the past (Wiener, 2004). For instance, we might seek, via engagement with lawmakers, to emulate the ‘just culture’ in the aviation industry, which is characterised by openly reporting, investigating and learning from mistakes (Reason, 1997; Syed, 2015). A regulatory system may require various powers, such as compelling developers to ‘roll back’ an AI assistant deployment, akin to product recall obligations for aviation manufacturers.""",False,"Risk A is not covered by any risk in Document B.

24.09.05,683,The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Cooperation,"The 2010 flash crash is an example of a runaway process caused by interacting algorithms. Runaway processes are characterised by feedback loops that accelerate the process itself. Typically, these feedback loops arise from the interaction of multiple agents in a population... Within highly complex systems, the emergence of runaway processes may be hard to predict, because the conditions under which positive feedback loops occur may be non-obvious. The system of interacting AI assistants, their human principals, other humans and other algorithms will certainly be highly complex. Therefore, there is ample opportunity for the emergence of positive feedback loops. This is especially true because the society in which this system is embedded is culturally evolving, and because the deployment of AI assistant technology itself is likely to speed up the rate of cultural evolution – understood here as the process through which cultures change over time – as communications technologies are wont to do (Kivinen and Piiroinen, 2023). This will motivate research programmes aimed at identifying positive feedback loops early on, at understanding which capabilities and deployments dampen runaway processes and which ones amplify them, and at building in circuit-breaker mechanisms that allow society to escape from potentially vicious cycles which could impact economies, government institutions, societal stability or individual freedoms (see Chapters 8, 16 and 17). The importance of circuit breakers is underlined by the observation that the evolution of human cooperation may well be ‘hysteretic’ as a function of societal conditions (Barfuss et al., 2023; Hintze and Adami, 2015). This means that a small directional change in societal conditions may, on occasion, trigger a transition to a defective equilibrium which requires a larger reversal of that change in order to return to the original cooperative equilibrium. We would do well to avoid such tipping points. Social media provides a compelling illustration of how tipping points can undermine cooperation: content that goes ‘viral’ tends to involve negativity bias and sometimes challenges core societal values (Mousavi et al., 2022; see Chapter 16). Nonetheless, the challenge posed by runaway processes should not be regarded as uniformly problematic. When harnessed appropriately and suitably bounded, we may even recruit them to support beneficial forms of cooperative AI. For example, it has been argued that economically useful ideas are becoming harder to find, thus leading to low economic growth (Bloom et al., 2020). By deploying AI assistants in the service of technological innovation, we may once again accelerate the discovery of ideas. New ideas, discovered in this way, can then be incorporated into the training data set for future AI assistants, thus expanding the knowledge base for further discoveries in a compounding way. In a similar vein, we can imagine AI assistant technology accumulating various capabilities for enhancing human cooperation, for instance by mimicking the evolutionary processes that have bootstrapped cooperative behavior in human society (Leibo et al., 2019). When used in these ways, the potential for feedback cycles that enable greater cooperation is a phenomenon that warrants further research and potential support.""",True,"Risk A is covered by Risk ID 2.2.6.3 in Document B because both address the concern of feedback loops in AI systems.

In this section, we link them more tightly to elements of the definition of an advanced AI assistant to better understand and mitigate potential issues – and lay the path for assistants that support widespread and inclusive opportunity and access.

24.10.03,687,The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Access and Opportunity risks,"""AI assistants currently tend to perform a limited set of isolated tasks: tools that classify or rank content execute a set of predefined rules or provide constrained suggestions, and chatbots are often encoded with guardrails to limit the set of conversation turns they execute (e.g. Warren, 2023; see Chapter 4). However, an artificial agent that can execute sequences of actions on the user’s behalf – with ‘significant autonomy to plan and execute tasks within the relevant domain’ (see Chapter 2) – offers a greater range of capabilities and depth of use. This raises several distinct access-related risks, with respect to liability and consent, that may disproportionately affect historically marginalised communities. To repeat, in cases where an action can only be executed with an advanced AI assistant, not having access to the technology (e.g. due to limited internet access, not speaking the ‘right’ language or facing a paywall) means one cannot access that action (consider today’s eBay and Ticketmaster bots). Communication with many utility or commercial providers currently requires (at least initial) interaction with their artificial agents (Schwerin, 2023; Verma, 2023a). It is not difficult to imagine a future in which a user needs an advanced AI assistant to interface with a more consequential resource, such as their hospital for appointments or their phone company to obtain service. Cases of inequitable performance, where the assistant systematically performs less well for certain communities (situation type 2), could impose serious costs on people in these contexts. Moreover, advanced AI assistants are expected to be designed to act in line with user expectations. When acting on the user’s behalf, an assistant will need to infer aspects of what the user wants. This process may involve interpretation to decide between various sources of information (e.g. stated preferences and inference based on past feedback or user behaviour) (see Chapter 5). However, cultural differences will also likely affect the system’s ability to make an accurate inference. Notably, the greater the cultural divide, say between that of the developers and the data on which the agent was trained and evaluated on, and that of the user, the harder it will be to make reliable inferences about user wants (e.g. Beede et al., 2020; Widner et al., 2023), and greater the likelihood of performance failures or value misalignment (see Chapter 11).

24.10.04,688,The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Access and Opportunity risks,"""Emergent access risks are most likely to arise when current and novel capabilities are combined. Emergent risks can be difficult to foresee fully (Ovadya and Whittlestone, 2019; Prunkl et al., 2021) due to the novelty of the technology (see Chapter 1) and the biases of those who engage in product design or foresight processes D’Ignazio and Klein (2020). Indeed, people who occupy relatively advantaged social, educational and economic positions in society are often poorly equipped to foresee and prevent harm because they are disconnected from lived experiences of those who would be affected. Drawing upon access concerns that surround existing technologies, we anticipate three possible trends: • Trend 1: Technology as societal infrastructure. If advanced AI assistants are adopted by organisations or governments in domains affecting material well-being, ‘opting out’ may no longer be a real option for people who want to continue to participate meaningfully in society. Indeed, if this trend holds, there could be serious consequences for communities with no access to AI assistants or who only have access to less capable systems (see also Chapter 14). For example, if advanced AI assistants gate access to information and resources, these resources could become inaccessible for people with limited knowledge of how to use these systems, reflecting the skill-based dimension of digital inequality (van Dijk, 2006). Addressing these questions involves reaching beyond technical and logistical access considerations – and expanding the scope of consideration to enable full engagement and inclusion for differently situated communities. • Trend 2: Exacerbating social and economic inequalities. Technologies are not distinct from but embedded within wider sociopolitical assemblages (Haraway, 1988; Harding, 1998, 2016). If advanced AI assistants are institutionalised and adopted at scale without proper foresight and mitigation measures in place, then they are likely to scale or exacerbate inequalities that already exist within the sociocultural context in which the system is used (Bauer and Lizotte, 2021; Zajko, 2022). If the historical record is anything to go by, the performance inequities evidenced by advanced AI assistants could mirror social hierarchies around gender, race, disability and culture, among others – asymmetries that deserve deeper consideration and need to be significantly addressed (e.g. Buolamwini and Gebru, 2018). • Trend 3: Rendering more urgent responsible AI development and deployment practices, such as those supporting the development of technologies that perform fairly and are accountable to a wide range of parties. As Corbett and Denton (2023, 1629) argue: ‘The impacts of achieving [accountability and fairness] in almost any situation immediately improves the conditions of people’s lives and better society’. However, many approaches to developing AI systems, including assistants, pay little attention to how context shapes what accountability or fairness means (Sartori and Theodorou, 2022), or how these concepts can be put in service of addressing inequalities related to motivational access (e.g. wanting/trust in technology) or use (e.g. different ways to use a technology) (van Dijk, 2006). Advanced AI assistants are complex technologies that will enable a plurality of data and content flows that necessitate in-depth analysis of social impacts. As many sociotechnical and responsible AI practices were developed for conventional ML technologies, it may be necessary to develop new frameworks, approaches and tactics (see Chapter 19).

24.11.01,690,The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Misinformation risks,"""Design choices such as greater personalisation of AI assistants and efforts to align them with human preferences could also reinforce people’s pre-existing biases and entrench specific ideologies. Increasingly agentic AI assistants trained using techniques such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and with the ability to access and analyse users’ behavioural data, for example, may learn to tailor their responses to users’ preferences and feedback. In doing so, these systems could end up producing partial or ideologically biased statements in an attempt to conform to user expectations, desires or preferences for a particular worldview (Carroll et al., 2022). Over time, this could lead AI assistants to inadvertently reinforce people’s tendency to interpret information in a way that supports their own prior beliefs (‘confirmation bias’), thus making them more entrenched in their own views and more resistant to factual corrections (Lewandowsky et al., 2012). At the societal level, this could also exacerbate the problem of epistemic fragmentation – a breakdown of shared knowledge, where individuals have conflicting understandings of reality and do not share or engage with each other’s beliefs – and further entrench specific ideologies. Excessive trust and overreliance on hyperpersonalised AI assistants could become especially problematic if people ended up deferring entirely to these systems to perform tasks in domains they do not have expertise in or to take consequential decisions on their behalf (see Chapter 12). For example, people may entrust an advanced AI assistant that is familiar with their political views and personal preferences to help them find trusted election information, guide them through their political choices or even vote on their behalf, even if doing so might go against their own or society’s best interests. In the more extreme cases, these developments may hamper the normal functioning of democracies, by decreasing people’s civic competency and reducing their willingness and ability to engage in productive political debate and to participate in public life (Sullivan and Transue, 1999).""",True,"Risk A is covered by Risk ID 2.2.1.3 in Document B because both address the concern of 'Confirmation Bias'.

24.11.02,691,The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Misinformation risks,"""Beyond this, the widespread adoption of advanced AI assistants for content generation could have a number of negative consequences for our shared information ecosystem. One concern is that it could result in a degradation of the quality of the information available online. Researchers have already observed an uptick in the amount of audiovisual misinformation, elaborate scams and fake websites created using generative AI tools (Hanley and Durumeric, 2023). As more and more people turn to AI assistants to autonomously create and disseminate information to public audiences at scale, it may become increasingly difficult to parse and verify reliable information. This could further threaten and complicate the status of journalists, subject-matter experts and public information sources. Over time, a proliferation of spam, misleading or low-quality synthetic content in online spaces could also erode the digital knowledge commons – the shared knowledge resources accessible to everyone on the web, such as publicly accessible data repositories (Huang and Siddarth, 2023). At its extreme, such degradation could also end up skewing people’s view of reality and scientific consensus, make them more doubtful of the credibility of all information they encounter and shape public discourse in unproductive ways. Moreover, in an online environment saturated with AI-generated content, more and more people may become reliant on personalised, highly capable AI assistants for their informational needs.

24.11.03,692,The Ethics of Advanced AI Assistants,Misinformation risks,"""Finally, AI assistants themselves could become weaponised by malicious actors to sow misinformation and manipulate public opinion at scale. Studies show that spreaders of disinformation tend to privilege quantity over quality of messaging, flooding online spaces repeatedly with misleading content to sow ‘seeds of doubt’ (Hassoun et al., 2023). Research on the ‘continued influence effect’ also shows that repeatedly being exposed to false information is more likely to influence someone’s thoughts than a single exposure. Studies show, for example, that repeated exposure to false information makes people more likely to believe it by increasing perceived social consensus, and it makes people more resistant to changing their minds even after being given a correction (for a review of these effects, see Lewandowsky et al., 2012; Ecker et al., 2022). By leveraging the frequent and personalised nature of repeated interactions with an AI assistant, malicious actors could therefore gradually nudge voters towards a particular viewpoint or sets of beliefs over time (see Chapters 8 and 9). Propagandists could also use AI assistants to make their disinformation campaigns more personalised and effective. There is growing evidence that AI-generated outputs are as persuasive as human arguments and have the potential to change people’s minds on hot-button issues (Bai et al., 2023; Myers, 2023). Recent research by the Center for Countering Digital Hate showed that LLMs could be successfully prompted to generate ‘persuasive misinformation’ in 78 out of 100 test cases, including content denying climate change (see Chapters 9 and 18). If compromised by malicious actors, in the future, highly capable and autonomous AI assistants could therefore be programmed to run astroturfing campaigns autonomously, tailor misinformation content to users in a hyperprecise way, by preying on their emotions and vulnerabilities, or to accelerate lobbying activities (Kreps and Kriner, 2023). As a result, people may be misled into believing that content produced by weaponised AI assistants came from genuine or authoritative sources. Covert influence operations of this kind may also be harder to detect than traditional disinformation campaigns, as virtual assistants primarily interact with users on a one-to-one basis and continuously generate new content (Goldstein et al., 2023).""",True,"Risk A is covered by Risk ID 2.4.1.b in Document B because both address the concern of AI being used to spread disinformation.

If these goals are distorted or corrupted, then this can lead to worse outcomes for the delegating agent(s) (Nguyen et al., 2024b; Sourbut et al., 2024).
